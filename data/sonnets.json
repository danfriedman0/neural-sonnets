      "The Age of a Dream",
      "Imageries of dream reveal a gracious age:\nBlack armour, falling lace, and altar lights at morn.\nThe courtesy of Saints, their gentleness and scorn,\nLights on an earth more fair, than shone from Plato's page:\nThe courtesy of knights, fair calm and sacred rage:\nThe courtesy of love, sorrow for love's sake borne.\nVanished, those high conceits! Desolate and forlorn,\nWe hunger against hope for that lost heritage.\nGone now, the carven work! Ruined, the golden shrine!\nNo more the glorious organs pour their voice divine;\nNo more rich frankincense drifts through the Holy Place:\nNow from the broken tower, what solemn bell still tolls,\nMourning what piteous death? Answer, O saddened souls!\nWho mourn the death of beauty and the death of grace."

Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away."

Trees and shrubs appear\nLike wraiths that beckon dumbly in the gloom,\nMysterious shapes that slowly grow more clear,\nThen--chirping birds, and flowers all a-bloom.\nAnd lo! the Sun--wielding a molten spear,\nLeaps, like a god, new-risen from his tomb."
