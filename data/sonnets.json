Its gold shoots twine\nHigh up in the air in sweet mock-martial line\nAs if its strength were all its own. Yet doff'd\nOf these its tendrils, prone upon the croft\nIn barren weakness must it soon recline.\nOnly the tendril blooms; only the flower\nGives fruit; and only for the fruit it brings\nDoes the vine live. The Christian soul likewise\nOnly in humble clinging finds its power;\nAnd like the Master's Vine, piercing the skies,\nBears fruit in that alone whereby it clings."

Sleep endures\nMore than the morning can, when shadows lie\nSharper than mountains, and the cleft is real\nBetween us and our kings.

      "\"Love and Fortune and my mind, rememb'rer\"",
      "Love and Fortune and my mind, rememb'rer\nOf that that is now with that that hath been,\nDo torment me so that I very often\nEnvy them beyond all measure.\nLove slayeth mine heart.  Fortune is depriver\nOf all my comfort.  The foolish mind then\nBurneth and plaineth as one that seldom\nLiveth in rest, still in displeasure.\nMy pleasant days, they fleet away and pass,\nBut daily yet the ill doth change into the worse,\nAnd more than the half is run of my course.\nAlas, not of steel but of\nI see that from mine hand falleth my trust,\nAnd all my thoughts are dashed into dust."

      "How oft have I, my dear and cruel foe,\nWith those your eyes for to get peace and truce\nProffered you mine heart!  But you do not use\nAmong so high things to cast your mind so low.\nIf any other look for it, as ye trow,\nTheir vain weak hope doth greatly them abuse.\nAnd thus I disdain that that ye refuse:\nIt was once mine, it can no more be so.\nIf I then it chase, nor it in you can find\nIn this exile no manner of comfort,\nNor live alone, nor, where he is called, resort,\nHe may wander from his natural kind.\nSo shall it be great hurt unto us twain\nAnd yours the loss and mine the deadly pain."

      "Like to these immeasurable mountains\nIs my painful life, the burden of ire:\nFor of great height be they and high is my desire,\nAnd I of tears and they be full of fountains.\nUnder craggy rocks they have full barren plains;\nHard thoughts in me my woeful mind doth tire.\nSmall fruit and many leaves their tops do attire;\nSmall effect with great trust in me remains.\nThe boist'rous winds oft their high boughs do blast;\nHot sighs from me continually be shed.\nCattle in them and in me love is fed.\nImmovable am I and they are full steadfast.\nOf the restless birds they have the tune and note,\nAnd I always plaints that pass thorough my throat."

      "Divers doth use, as I have heard and know,\nWhen that to change their ladies do begin,\nTo mourn and wail, and never for to lin,\nHoping thereby to pease their painful woe.\nAnd some there be, that when it chanceth so\nThat women change and hate where love hath been,\nThey call them false and think with words to win\nThe hearts of them which otherwhere doth grow.\nBut as for me, though that by chance indeed\nChange hath outworn the favor that I had,\nI will not wail, lament, nor yet be sad,\nNor call her false that falsely did me feed,\nBut let it pass, and think it is of kind\nThat often change doth please a woman's mind."

      "Poets make pets of pretty, docile words:\nI love smooth words, like gold-enameled fish\nWhich circle slowly with a silken swish,\nAnd tender ones, like downy-feathered birds:\nWords shy and dappled, deep-eyed deer in herds,\nCome to my hand, and playful if I wish,\nOr purring softly at a silver disk,\nBlue Persian kittens, fed on cream and curds.\nI love bright words, words up and singing early;\nWords that are luminous in the dark, and sing;\nWarm lazy words, white cattle under trees;\nI love words opalescent, cool, and pearly,\nLike midsummer moths, and honied words like bees,\nGilded and sticky, with a little sting."
